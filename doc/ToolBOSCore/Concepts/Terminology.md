## Terminology

### Canonical path

A software package can be specified / identified by its relative location
within the _Software Installation Tree (SIT)_. For example, the ToolBOSCore
package can be found at `/hri/sit/latest/DevelopmentTools/ToolBOSCore/4.0`.

The first part `/hri/sit/latest` (= SIT path) is common for all packages.
Hence it is sufficient to shortly say `DevelopmentTools/ToolBOSCore/4.0`
to clearly reference a certain package. This is the _canonical path_ of the
package.
