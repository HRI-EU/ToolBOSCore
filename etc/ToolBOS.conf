#  Note that the file shipped with ToolBOSCore itself is also a complete
#  and up-to-date reference list.  Those are all entries one may set in
#  the ToolBOS.conf files, which are searched in this order:
#
#          1) within the current working directory
#          2) within ~/.HRI/ToolBOS  (user's home directory)
#          3) within /etc/HRI (set by the system administrator)
#          4) within the ToolBOSCore package itself (default / fallback)
#
#  If some values are commented-out below it means there is no reasonable
#  default value. In such case the actual code has to deal with this.
