programming language (usually naming the keyword atomic).
This guarantees that the operation is atomic under all circumstances.
On the other hand, an operation can be atomic just as a side effect of a
certain combination of interpreter/compiler implementation and target
platform, f.i. there is documentation that some Python operations are atomic
under the current CPython implementation. However this might not be true in
