usage: sitorphan.py [-h] [-a] [-v] [-V]

List packages which have no dependee (inspired by "deborphan"). Note
that some SIT categories (such as "Applications" or "Modules/BBCM")
contain packages which typically have no dependee by design. They are
excluded by default, pass "--all" to also show them.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -a, --all      show all SIT packages without dependee
  -v, --verbose  show debug messages
  -V, --version  show version info and exit

examples:
  sitorphan.py
